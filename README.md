# HelloWorld
First repository

Hello World!

This is my first repository on github. I am an aspiring software developer looking to further my knowledge in software creation through opensource opportunities. I am currently working in the IT field as a field technican while I finish my BS in Software Application Programming. Currently, Java is my go-to language as it is the language I have spent the most time studying. I am looking forward to helping do my part to contribute to the strong community here at Github!
